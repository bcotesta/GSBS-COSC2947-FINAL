# COLABORATION RULES
- ALWAYS BRANCH OUT when adding new features.
- Check with the entire group before you merge into main.
- Comment your name and the date at the top of every file.
- Make your code easy to read - Good comments and consistent variable names.
- Stray away from generative AI and copilot usage

## BRANCH NAMING CONVENTIONS
prefix/descriptive name/your name

- The prefix will be like 'feature' or 'bugfix' or 'design' or whatever it is you are currently working on. for me right now once I start branching off it will probably be 'core' since im working on the core of the project.
- descriptive name is like 'class & structure setup' or 'SQL integration' or whatever
- and for your name you could also inlude your student # if you feel so inclined.

so for example: **'core/class-and-structure-setup/BrandonCotesta-0456970'** would be a suitable branch name for what is being worked on right now.
